	* Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can 		access it as window.
	* It represents any HTML document or web page 
	  that is loaded in the browser.
	* It is loaded inside the window.
	* It is the object of window property.
	* All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML
	  are part of the document.
	* We can access the document from a window using

	* It is the object of the browser.
	* Global objects, functions, and variables of 
	   JavaScript are members of the window object
	* We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
	* The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
	* Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
